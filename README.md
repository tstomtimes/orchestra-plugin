# Orchestra for Claude Code

Turn Claude Code into a **semi-autonomous development team** with specialized AI agents, automated quality gates, and seamless integrations.

English | [日本語](README.ja.md)

> 🔒 **Security**: Orchestra Plugin uses automated hooks with built-in safety guards. Dangerous operations are automatically blocked. See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for details.

## Why Orchestra?

**Just use Claude Code as you normally would.** No new commands to learn, no complex workflows. Orchestra Plugin works quietly in the background:

- 🤖 **Multi-agent coordination** - Alex (PM), Eden (QA), Iris (Security), Mina (Frontend), Theo (DevOps) collaborate automatically
- 🛡️ **Automated quality gates** - Pre-merge checks, security scans, test validation run automatically
- 🔌 **Seamless integrations** - GitHub, Vercel, Shopify, Slack - all connected and ready
- 🌐 **Browser automation** - Built-in Playwright integration for web testing and automation
- 🧠 **Memory Bank integration** - Persistent project knowledge that survives session restarts
- 🎯 **Evidence-based** - Changelogs, test plans, and documentation generated automatically

**It just works.** Install once, code naturally.

## Quick Start

### Installation

Orchestra Plugin requires MCP servers to be set up locally. Follow these steps:

#### 1. Clone and Configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tstomtimes/orchestra.git
cd orchestra
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your GitHub token (required) and optional service tokens
```

#### 2. Run Setup Script

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This installs:
- Node.js dependencies (Express, Playwright, TypeScript)
- Playwright Chromium browser for automation
- Python virtual environment and packages (elevenlabs, requests)
- All MCP servers (Browser, GitHub, Vercel, Shopify, Slack, etc.)
- Memory Bank initialization (persistent project knowledge)
- Hooks and quality gates

Alternatively, you can run the setup from within Claude Code:

```
/orchestra-setup
```

#### 3. Install Plugin in Claude Code

In Claude Code, run:

```
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/orchestra
/plugin install orchestra
```

Replace `/path/to/orchestra` with the full path to your cloned repository.

#### 4. Restart Claude Code

Restart Claude Code to activate all features.

## Using Orchestra in Other Projects

After installing the Orchestra Plugin, **configure each project** where you want to use it:

### 1. Copy and Configure Settings

Copy the `.claude/settings.json` file from the Orchestra repository:

```bash
# In your project directory
cd /path/to/your-project

# Create .claude directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .claude

# Copy Orchestra settings
cp /path/to/orchestra/.claude/settings.json .claude/settings.json
```

### 2. Update Plugin Path

**IMPORTANT:** Edit `.claude/settings.json` and update the `path` to point to your Orchestra installation:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "orchestra-marketplace": {
      "source": {
        "source": "directory",
        "path": "/absolute/path/to/orchestra"  ← Update this!
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/absolute/path/to/orchestra` with the full path where you cloned the Orchestra repository.

**What this enables:**
- ✅ Auto-approval for all safe tools (dangerous commands blocked by safety guard)
- ✅ Access to 12 specialized agents
- ✅ Automatic hook execution (agent routing, safety guards, quality gates)
- ✅ Slash commands (`/browser`, `/screenshot`, `/orchestra-setup`)

### 3. Restart Claude Code

Restart Claude Code to apply the configuration.

### 4. Ready to Use

All Orchestra features are now available in your project:
- ✅ 12 specialized agents (Alex, Riley, Skye, Finn, Eden, Kai, Leo, Iris, Nova, Mina, Theo, Blake)
- ✅ Automatic agent routing
- ✅ Auto-approval with safety guard (only dangerous commands blocked)
- ✅ Slash commands (`/browser`, `/screenshot`, `/orchestra-setup`)

**Important:** The plugin's hooks, agents, and commands **work automatically**. No additional files needed in your project. Just copy `.claude/settings.json` and you're done.

### Start Coding

Use Claude Code exactly as before. Orchestra Plugin enhances everything automatically:

```
You: "Add a user profile page with avatar upload"

→ Alex (PM) breaks down the task
→ Mina (Frontend) handles UI implementation
→ Eden (QA) validates quality
→ Iris (Security) checks for vulnerabilities
→ Pre-merge hooks ensure everything passes
→ Changelog and docs generated automatically
```

## Features That Work Automatically

### Memory Bank Integration

**Orchestra automatically initializes persistent project knowledge** that survives Claude Code session restarts.

**What is Memory Bank?**

Memory Bank is a persistent knowledge storage system that maintains project context across sessions. Instead of re-explaining your project every time Claude Code restarts, Memory Bank preserves:

- **Project overview and current state** - High-level context about your project
- **Technology stack and dependencies** - What technologies you're using and why
- **Important decisions and rationale** - Key technical decisions with context
- **Progress tracking and milestones** - What's been completed and what's next
- **Next steps and action items** - Immediate priorities and roadmap

**How it works:**

1. **Automatic Setup**: Running `./setup.sh` automatically initializes Memory Bank with 5 structured template files in `~/memory-bank/orchestra/`
2. **Session Persistence**: Project knowledge is preserved between Claude Code sessions
3. **Agent Access**: All Orchestra agents read and update Memory Bank files for consistent context
4. **Document Sync**: Changes in `.orchestra/specs/` automatically sync to Memory Bank
5. **Milestone Tracking**: Progress is automatically recorded after deployments and major changes

**Benefits:**

- **No more context re-explanation** - Claude remembers your project across sessions
- **Consistent agent knowledge** - All agents share the same project understanding
- **Automatic documentation** - Project knowledge is captured as you work
- **Progress visibility** - Track milestones and progress over time

**Learn more**: See [MEMORY_BANK_GUIDE.md](MEMORY_BANK_GUIDE.md) for complete documentation on using Memory Bank.

### Automated Hook System

Orchestra Plugin includes a comprehensive hook system that runs automatically:

**Active Hooks (Configured in `hooks/hooks.json`):**

1. **UserPromptSubmit Hook** - Runs when you submit any prompt
   - `agent-routing-reminder.sh` - Analyzes your request and suggests appropriate specialist agents
     - Detects keywords like "authentication", "database", "UI", "faster", etc.
     - Automatically triggers routing reminders to ensure the right agents are invoked
   - `before_task.sh` - Task clarity reminder
     - Suggests best practices for well-defined tasks
     - Checks for ambiguous language and recommends Riley agent when needed

2. **PreToolUse Hook** - Runs before any tool executes
   - `user-prompt-submit.sh` - Safety guard that blocks dangerous operations
     - Prevents destructive commands (`rm -rf`, system file modifications, etc.)
     - Ensures autonomous operation stays safe
   - `workflow-dispatcher.sh` - Routes workflow commands to quality gates
     - Detects `gh pr create` → runs `before_pr.sh` (lint, type check, tests, security scan)
     - Detects `git merge` → runs `before_merge.sh` (E2E tests, Lighthouse checks)
     - Detects deploy commands → runs `before_deploy.sh` (env validation, migration checks)

3. **PostToolUse Hook** - Runs after tool execution completes
   - `workflow-post-dispatcher.sh` - Post-workflow validation
     - Detects deploy commands → runs `after_deploy.sh` (smoke tests, health checks)

4. **SessionStart Hook** - Runs when Claude Code starts
   - Displays welcome message confirming Orchestra Plugin is loaded
   - Initializes agent coordination system

All hooks gracefully skip if tools aren't installed. No errors, no friction.

### Agent Auto-Routing (Completely Automatic)

**Orchestra automatically detects which specialist should handle your request** - you never need to manually invoke agents.

**How it works:**
- Every prompt is analyzed by the `agent-routing-reminder.sh` hook
- Keywords and patterns trigger appropriate specialist agents
- Routing reminders appear with clear guidance
- Works in **all projects** where Orchestra is enabled, not just this repo

**Example triggers:**

| You Say | Auto-Routes To | Why |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| "Make the dashboard faster" | Riley → Nova | "faster" is ambiguous; Riley clarifies, then Nova optimizes |
| "Add new authentication system" | Alex → Kai + Iris + Mina | Major feature needs coordination, architecture, security, integration |
| "Add users table to database" | Leo → Skye | Database schema design, then implementation |
| "Integrate Stripe payments" | Mina → Iris | External service integration + security audit |
| "Fix login form accessibility" | Nova | UI/UX and accessibility expertise |

**You don't need to think about which agent to use.** Just describe what you want naturally, and Orchestra routes to the right specialists automatically.

### Parallel Agent Execution

**Orchestra Plugin intelligently runs agents in parallel when possible**, dramatically reducing completion time while maintaining quality.

**How it works:**
- Alex (the conductor) analyzes task dependencies
- Independent tasks run concurrently in the background
- Dependent tasks execute sequentially to maintain correctness
- All results are coordinated and reviewed together

**Example parallel workflows:**

**Implementation Phase** (running in parallel):
```
User: "Add user authentication system"

Alex coordinates:
├─ Skye (Implementation) ──┐
├─ Finn (Test writing)    ──┤─→ All complete → Review together
└─ Eden (Documentation)   ──┘
```

**Review Phase** (running in parallel):
```
After implementation:

├─ Iris (Security scan)   ──┐
├─ Nova (UX review)       ──┤─→ All clear → Proceed to merge
└─ Leo (Schema validation)──┘
```

**Pre-Release Phase** (running in parallel):
```
Before deployment:

├─ Blake (Changelog)          ──┐
├─ Eden (Release notes)       ──┤─→ Ready to ship
└─ Theo (Monitoring setup)    ──┘
```

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ **3-5x faster** completion for multi-domain tasks
- 🎯 **Automatic optimization** - no manual coordination needed
- 🔒 **Safe parallelization** - dependencies are always respected
- 📊 **Full visibility** - see all agent outputs before proceeding

**Common parallel patterns:**
- Code + Tests + Docs (independent work on same feature)
- Security + UX + Performance (independent reviews)
- Frontend + Backend + Database (independent implementation layers)

The orchestration happens automatically. Just describe what you need, and Alex coordinates the most efficient execution.
