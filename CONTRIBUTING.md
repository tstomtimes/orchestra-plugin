- Each agent should have a clear, specific role
- Define expertise areas and responsibilities explicitly
- Include collaboration patterns with other agents
- Follow the existing agent structure in `orchestra/agents/`

For new skills:
- Place core skills in `orchestra/skills/core/`
- Place mode-specific skills in `orchestra/skills/modes/`
- Update `policies/skills-map.yaml` to define when skills are invoked
- Ensure skills are stack-agnostic when possible

### Testing

- Verify integration with existing agents and skills
- Ensure hooks execute correctly
- Check that evidence artifacts are generated properly
