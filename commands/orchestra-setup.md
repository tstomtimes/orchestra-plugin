# Orchestra Plugin Setup

Run the complete setup script to install all MCP servers, dependencies, and configure the Orchestra Plugin environment.

## Task

Execute the Orchestra setup script to install:
- Node.js dependencies (Express, Playwright, TypeScript)
- Playwright Chromium browser
- Python virtual environment and packages (elevenlabs, requests)
- Configure hooks and permissions
- Create necessary directories (artifacts, etc.)

## Steps

1. Check if setup.sh exists and is executable:
   ```bash
   if [ ! -f "./setup.sh" ]; then
     echo "❌ setup.sh not found. Please ensure you're in the Orchestra repository root."
     exit 1
   fi
   ```

2. Make setup.sh executable if needed:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ./setup.sh
   ```

3. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

4. After completion, show next steps:
   ```
   ✅ Orchestra Plugin setup completed!

   Next steps:
   1. Edit .env file to add your API keys (if not done already)
   2. Restart Claude Code to activate all features
   3. Start coding - Orchestra will automatically enhance your workflow!

   Available features:
   - /browser - Start Browser MCP server
   - /screenshot - Capture web screenshots
   - 12 specialized AI agents (Alex, Riley, Skye, Finn, Eden, Kai, Leo, Iris, Nova, Mina, Theo, Blake)
   - Automated quality gates (before_task, before_pr, before_merge, before_deploy, after_deploy)
   - Multi-agent orchestration with parallel execution
   ```

## Notes

- This command should be run once after cloning the Orchestra repository
- The setup script checks for prerequisites (Node.js 18+, Python 3.8+)
- All hooks automatically skip if tools aren't installed (no errors)
- Environment variables can be configured later in the .env file
- Only GITHUB_TOKEN is required; all other tokens are optional
- The script creates symlinks for hooks and slash commands
- Browser server can be started separately with `/browser` command
