# Orchestra Plugin - Project Overview

**Created:** TIMESTAMP_PLACEHOLDER
**Project:** orchestra
**Type:** AI-Powered Development Workflow Automation System

---

## Purpose

The Orchestra Plugin is a comprehensive development workflow automation system that integrates with Claude Code. It provides:

1. **Multi-Agent Orchestration** - 12 specialized AI agents (Alex, Riley, Skye, Finn, Eden, Kai, Leo, Iris, Nova, Mina, Theo, Blake) that handle specific development tasks
2. **Automated Quality Gates** - Hooks for task clarity, PR validation, merge checks, deployment verification
3. **MCP Server Integration** - Browser automation, memory bank, and voice notifications via ElevenLabs
4. **Document-Driven Development** - Enforces documentation, architecture, and test-first workflows

---

## Current State

### Implementation Status
- ✅ Core plugin architecture with 12 agents
- ✅ Git hook system (before_task, before_pr, before_merge, before_deploy, after_deploy)
- ✅ MCP servers (Browser, Memory Bank, ElevenLabs)
- ✅ Slash commands (/browser, /screenshot, /orchestra-setup)
- ✅ Document-Driven Development framework (.orchestra/specs/)
- 🚧 Memory Bank integration (in progress)
- ⏳ Agent auto-routing enhancement (planned)

# Orchestra Plugin - Important Decisions

**Created:** TIMESTAMP_PLACEHOLDER
**Project:** orchestra

---

## Overview

This file tracks significant decisions made during the development of the Orchestra Plugin. Each decision includes context, alternatives considered, and rationale.

---

## Decision Log

### D-001: Multi-Agent Architecture
**Date:** 2025-11
**Status:** ✅ Implemented
**Context:**
Need for specialized expertise in different development domains (requirements, coding, review, architecture, etc.)

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Single monolithic agent handling all tasks
2. Manual task routing by users
3. Multi-agent system with auto-routing

**Decision:**
Implement 12 specialized agents with auto-routing capabilities.

**Rationale:**
- Specialization improves output quality
- Auto-routing reduces cognitive load on users
- Easier to maintain and extend specific domain expertise
- Supports parallel execution of independent tasks

**Consequences:**
- Increased system complexity
- Need for agent coordination protocols
- Potential for routing errors (mitigated by before_task hook)

---

### D-002: Git Hook Integration
**Date:** 2025-11
**Status:** ✅ Implemented
**Context:**
Need to enforce quality gates at key development lifecycle points.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Manual quality checks
2. CI/CD-only validation
3. Git hooks + Claude Code lifecycle hooks

**Decision:**
Implement comprehensive hook system covering before_task, before_pr, before_merge, before_deploy, after_deploy.

**Rationale:**
- Catches issues early in development cycle
- Reduces CI/CD failures and wasted time
- Provides immediate feedback to developers
- Enforces consistent standards across team

**Consequences:**
- Requires hook installation during setup
- Can slow down development if hooks are too strict
- Need for lenient mode for rapid prototyping

---

### D-003: Memory Bank Integration
**Date:** 2025-11
**Status:** 🚧 In Progress
**Context:**
Need for persistent project knowledge that survives Claude Code session restarts.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Session-based context only (default Claude behavior)
2. File-based project documentation
3. Memory Bank MCP server integration

**Decision:**
Integrate Memory Bank MCP server with structured project knowledge files.

**Rationale:**
- Persists key project information across sessions
- Reduces need to re-explain project context
- Enables knowledge sharing between agents
- Structured format ensures consistency

**Consequences:**
- Requires Memory Bank setup and initialization
- Need to keep Memory Bank files synchronized with code
- Storage management for large projects

---

### D-004: Document-Driven Development
**Date:** 2025-11
**Status:** ✅ Implemented
**Context:**
Need to maintain alignment between documentation, tests, and code.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Code-first development with optional docs
2. Test-first development only
3. Document-driven with test-driven development

**Decision:**
Implement comprehensive Document-Driven Development framework with `.orchestra/specs/`.

**Rationale:**
- Reduces technical debt and misaligned implementations
- Improves team communication and onboarding
- Facilitates change management and impact analysis
- Supports compliance and audit requirements

**Consequences:**
- Increased upfront documentation effort
- Need for sync validation tooling
- Requires cultural shift in development practices

---

### D-005: TypeScript for Core Logic
**Date:** 2025-11
**Status:** ✅ Implemented
**Context:**
Need for type-safe, maintainable codebase for plugin and MCP servers.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Pure JavaScript
2. TypeScript
3. Python for all components

**Decision:**
Use TypeScript for plugin logic and MCP servers (except ElevenLabs).

**Rationale:**
- Strong type system catches errors at compile time
- Better IDE support and developer experience
- Easier to refactor and maintain
- Industry standard for Node.js applications

**Consequences:**
- Compilation step required
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with TypeScript
- Type definition maintenance overhead

---

### D-006: Vitest over Jest
**Date:** 2025-11
**Status:** ✅ Implemented
**Context:**
Need for fast, TypeScript-friendly testing framework.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Jest (most popular)
2. Mocha + Chai
3. Vitest (modern Vite-based)

**Decision:**
Use Vitest as primary testing framework.

**Rationale:**
- Native TypeScript support without configuration
- Faster execution than Jest
- Modern API compatible with Jest
- Better watch mode and developer experience

**Consequences:**
- Smaller ecosystem compared to Jest
- Need to ensure compatibility with existing Jest-based projects
- Potential migration effort if switching back to Jest

---

### D-007: Lenient Mode by Default
**Date:** 2025-11
**Status:** ✅ Implemented
**Context:**
Balance between quality enforcement and developer velocity.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Strict mode always enforced
2. Lenient mode with warnings only
3. Configurable mode per project

**Decision:**
Default to lenient mode with configurable strict mode option.

**Rationale:**
- Reduces friction during rapid prototyping
- Allows gradual adoption of best practices
- Provides warnings to educate developers
- Teams can enable strict mode when ready

**Consequences:**
- Risk of ignored warnings accumulating
- Need for clear migration path to strict mode
- Requires good warning messages and documentation

---

### D-008: File-based Memory Bank Storage
**Date:** 2025-11
**Status:** ✅ Implemented
**Context:**
Storage mechanism for Memory Bank project knowledge.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Database storage (SQLite, PostgreSQL)
2. File-based storage (Markdown files)
3. Cloud-based storage (S3, GitHub)

**Decision:**
Use file-based storage in `~/memory-bank/` directory.

**Rationale:**
- Simple to implement and maintain
- Human-readable and editable
- No database dependencies
- Easy to version control if needed

**Consequences:**
- Limited query capabilities compared to databases
- Need for file naming conventions
- Potential performance issues with large projects

## How to Use This File

Update this file:
- **Daily:** Mark completed items, add new urgent tasks
- **Weekly:** Review and reprioritize items, move completed to progress.md
- **Monthly:** Update medium-term goals based on completed work
- **Quarterly:** Review long-term vision and adjust roadmap

### Priority Guidelines
- 🔴 **High Priority:** Must be done this week, blocks other work
- 🟡 **Medium Priority:** Should be done soon, impacts quality or velocity
- 🟢 **Low Priority:** Nice to have, improves polish or DX

**Related Files:**
- [progress.md](./progress.md) - Track completed work
- [project-overview.md](./project-overview.md) - Current project state
- [decisions.md](./decisions.md) - Context for why certain steps exist
