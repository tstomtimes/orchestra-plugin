description: |
  Skill for ensuring all code follows project conventions and best practices.
  Used by Skye, Kai, Leo, Mina, and Iris.
principles:
  - Code must be readable, consistent, and testable.
  - Prefer explicitness over cleverness.
  - Document assumptions inline when logic is non-trivial.
checks:
  - Lint and type checks pass (ESLint, mypy, etc.)
  - Code includes comments for complex logic.
  - Sensitive data is never logged or exposed.
