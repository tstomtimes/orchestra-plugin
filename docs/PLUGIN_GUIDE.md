## Parallel Agent Execution Patterns

Orchestra Plugin **executes agents in parallel whenever possible**, reducing completion time by 3-5x.

### Typical Parallel Patterns

**Implementation Phase (Parallel)**:
```
New Feature Addition
├─ Skye (Backend implementation)     ─┐
├─ Mina (Frontend implementation)    ─┤─→ Concurrent execution
└─ Finn (Test creation)              ─┘
```

**Review Phase (Parallel)**:
```
Post-implementation quality checks
├─ Iris (Security scan)              ─┐
├─ Nova (UX/Accessibility)           ─┤─→ Independent reviews
└─ Eden (Documentation)              ─┘
```

**Release Preparation (Parallel)**:
```
Pre-deployment preparation
├─ Blake (Changelog)                 ─┐
├─ Eden (Release notes)              ─┤─→ Parallel preparation
└─ Theo (Monitoring setup)           ─┘
```

### Principles of Parallel Agent Execution

1. **Always parallelize independent work**
   - Code implementation and test creation (different approaches to same spec)
   - Security, UX, performance reviews (independent perspectives)
   - Frontend, backend, database (independent layers)

2. **Let Alex coordinate**
   - When receiving complex tasks, delegate task breakdown and parallelization to Alex
   - Alex analyzes dependencies and plans optimal execution

3. **Execute in parallel with Task tool**
   - Use multiple Task tool calls in a single message
   - Always parallelize when agents can work independently

## Leveraging Skills and Policies

### Core Skills (skills/core/)

- **clarify.yaml**: Requirements clarification process
- **coding-standards.yaml**: Coding standards and best practices
- **documentation.yaml**: Documentation creation guidelines
- **performance.yaml**: Performance optimization
- **qa.yaml**: Quality assurance process
- **release.yaml**: Release management
- **review-checklist.yaml**: Code review checklist
- **security.yaml**: Security guidelines
- **token-efficiency.md**: Token efficiency strategies

### Mode Skills (skills/modes/)

- **api.yaml**: API development mode
- **db.yaml**: Database work mode
- **integration.yaml**: Integration development mode
- **migration.yaml**: Migration management mode
- **performance.yaml**: Performance optimization mode
- **qa.yaml**: QA mode
- **release.yaml**: Release mode

Use appropriate skill combinations based on each task.

## Automated Quality Gates

The following hooks run automatically:

### On SessionStart
- **before_task.sh**: Validates task clarity, delegates to Riley if ambiguous

### Before PR Creation (PreToolUse: gh pr create)
- **before_pr.sh**:
  - Lint checks
  - Type checks
  - Unit test execution
  - Secret scanning
  - SBOM generation

### Before Merge (PreToolUse: git merge)
- **before_merge.sh**:
  - E2E test execution
  - Performance testing
  - Security scanning

### Before Deploy (PreToolUse: vercel deploy)
- **before_deploy.sh**:
  - Environment variable validation
  - Migration checks
  - Dependency verification

### After Deploy (PostToolUse: vercel deploy)
- **after_deploy.sh**:
  - Smoke test execution
  - Health checks
  - Notifications (Slack, etc.)

**Important**: These hooks automatically skip if required tools are not installed. They will never cause errors.

## MCP Integration Services

The following MCP servers are pre-configured:

- **mcp-servers/github/**: GitHub PR management, issue tracking
- **mcp-servers/vercel/**: Deploy automation, preview management
- **mcp-servers/browser/**: Playwright integration, screenshots, E2E tests
- **mcp-servers/shopify/**: Theme development, store management
- **mcp-servers/slack/**: Team notifications, incident reporting
- **Others**: Sanity, Supabase, ElevenLabs, etc.

They become automatically available when you set appropriate tokens in the `.env` file.

## Recommended Development Flow

### 1. Task Reception & Clarification
```
User: "Add authentication system"

→ Launch Alex (Task tool)
  → Alex detects requirement ambiguity
    → Delegates to Riley for clarification
      → Define acceptance criteria and success metrics
```

### 2. Architecture Design (if needed)
```
→ Launch Kai (parallelizable if applicable)
  → System design, ADR creation
  → Interface definition
```

### 3. Implementation (Parallel Execution)
```
Parallel execution:
├─ Skye: Backend API implementation
├─ Mina: Frontend UI implementation
├─ Leo: Database schema and migrations
└─ Finn: Automated test suite creation
```

### 4. Quality Checks (Parallel Execution)
```
Parallel execution:
├─ Iris: Security scanning
├─ Nova: UX/Accessibility review
└─ Eden: Manual QA, edge case testing
```

### 5. Documentation Creation (Parallel Execution)
```
Parallel execution:
├─ Eden: README, API documentation updates
└─ Kai: ADR, technical decision records
```

### 6. PR Creation
```
→ before_pr.sh runs automatically (lint, tests, security scan)
→ gh pr create
```

### 7. Release Preparation
```
Parallel execution:
├─ Blake: Changelog, release notes creation
└─ Theo: Monitoring, alert configuration verification
```

### 8. Deployment
```
→ before_deploy.sh runs automatically (env vars, migration verification)
→ Execute deployment
→ after_deploy.sh runs automatically (smoke tests, notifications)
```

### 9. Monitoring
```
→ Theo: Post-deployment monitoring, early problem detection
```

## Runtime Guidelines

### Always Think Multi-Agent

❌ **Avoid**:
```
User: "Add user profile feature"
→ Start implementation directly
```

✅ **Recommended**:
```
User: "Add user profile feature"
→ Launch Alex for overall coordination
  → Clarify requirements with Riley
  → Parallel execution:
    ├─ Skye: Backend implementation
    ├─ Mina: Frontend implementation
    └─ Finn: Test creation
  → Parallel execution:
    ├─ Iris: Security checks
    └─ Nova: UX review
  → Eden: Documentation creation
```

### Prioritize Parallel Execution

Always execute independent tasks in parallel:

```
# ✅ Correct: Multiple Task tool calls in a single message
Task tool: Skye (Implementation)
Task tool: Finn (Tests)
Task tool: Eden (Documentation)

# ❌ Wrong: Sequential execution one by one
Task tool: Skye (Implementation)
→ Wait for completion
Task tool: Finn (Tests)
→ Wait for completion
Task tool: Eden (Documentation)
```

### Explicit Skill References

While each agent automatically leverages relevant skills, explicitly reference specific skills when you want to emphasize them:

```
"Implement following API development mode (skills/modes/api.yaml)"
"Strictly apply security guidelines (skills/core/security.yaml)"
```

### Trust Quality Gates

Manual quality checks are unnecessary as hooks run automatically:

```
# ❌ Unnecessary
"Run tests" (before_pr.sh runs automatically)
"Run security scan" (before_pr.sh runs automatically)

# ✅ Trust the hooks
"gh pr create" → before_pr.sh automatically checks everything
```

### Agent Selection Criteria

1. **Ambiguity present** → Riley
2. **Architecture involved** → Kai
3. **Clear implementation task** → Skye
4. **External API integration** → Mina
5. **Database changes** → Leo
6. **UI/UX improvements** → Nova
7. **Test creation** → Finn
8. **Security** → Iris
9. **Release preparation** → Blake
10. **Documentation/QA** → Eden
11. **Operations/Monitoring** → Theo
12. **Complex/Cross-cutting tasks** → Alex (Coordinator)

## Autonomous Operation Mode

Orchestra Plugin's **auto-approval hook (hooks/user-prompt-submit.sh)** automatically approves safe operations and blocks dangerous ones:

### Automatically Blocked Dangerous Operations
- System directory deletion (`rm -rf /`, `rm -rf ~`)
- Git force push (`git push --force`)
- Database drops (`DROP DATABASE`)
- Dangerous permission changes (`chmod 777`)
- System file modifications (`/etc/passwd`, etc.)

### Safe Operations Auto-Approved
- Regular git operations (commit, push, pull)
- Builds, test execution
- File read/write operations
- API calls

This enables extended autonomous sessions.

## Environment Variables

Only **GITHUB_TOKEN** is required. All others are optional:

```bash
# Required
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxx

# Optional (configure based on features you use)
VERCEL_TOKEN=xxxxx
SHOPIFY_ADMIN_TOKEN=xxxxx
SANITY_TOKEN=xxxxx
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE=xxxxx
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xxxxx
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=xxxxx
```

Features for unconfigured tokens are automatically disabled and work without errors.

## Summary

1. **Always start with Alex** to coordinate complex tasks
2. **Maximize parallel execution** for efficiency
3. **Apply skills and policies** appropriately
4. **Trust quality gates** (they run automatically)
5. **Delegate to specialized agents** appropriately
6. **Seamlessly integrate** with external services via MCP

Orchestra Plugin transforms you from a single AI assistant into a **collaborative team of 12 specialized experts**. Leverage each agent's expertise, maximize efficiency through parallel execution, and ensure safety with automated quality gates.
