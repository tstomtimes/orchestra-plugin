  Skill for disambiguating unclear requests.

  - Never assume intent — verify.
  - Confirm context, motivation, outcomes, and constraints.
patterns:
  - "Could you describe the current issue or goal more concretely?"
  - "What would success look like for this task?"
  - "Are there any specific risks, dependencies, or constraints?"
usage_examples:
